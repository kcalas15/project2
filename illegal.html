 <h1> Abortion was illegal! </h1>
 <img src="images/jesus.jpg" width="50%"/>
  <p>In the mid-to-late 1800s states began passing laws that made abortion illegal. During the 1800s all procedures 
were extremely risky. there were barely any hospitals, antiseptics were non existent, and the best doctors 
had only knowledge of very few things that didn't include abortion. The dangers from 
  abortion were similar to the dangers from other surgeries that were not outlawed at the time. </p>
