Hey there! My name is kayla Calas, I am 15 years of age, I attend Da vinci highschool and I am pro-life. I never
 really cared about what people did with their bodies until freshman year. Da vinci is a school where people are
 allowed to express their beliefs and opinions so I was really exposed to alot I didn't really think about freshman
 year. In 9th grade I was always around people who were pro choice so i didn't have my own thoughts on it until i did 
 research and my thoughts on abortion completely changed. I Went from not caring at all to being completely against it
 and having totally different thoughts on it. My page will be very bias so if you get offended at all when it comes to 
 abortion, Please do not read:)
