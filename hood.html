	There are multiple videos that have been released implicating that Planned 
	parenthood has been selling infant body parts. A large amount of Planned parenthood's income is from Abortions, 
	Planned parent hood claims that only 3% of their income is from abortion which is a complete lie. Planned
	Parenthood's made around $163,826,500 from abortions in 2013-2014. Guessing each abortion payed for in the 
	first trimester was around $500 and in the second trimester was $1000. Saying that Planned parenthood only 
	does 3% of abortions only is exactly like saying that a car dealership only does a small percentage of
	selling cars. Even though car dealerships provide other things like financing, washing cars, service on 
	cars, of leasing car but the problem with that is a car dealerships main priority is selling cars. Planned
	parenthood also claims they do many Prenatal services which is another lie because they only do 0.27% 
	of prenatal services and thats only 18,684 Prenatal services in 2013-2014. Planned parenthood also give out low
	dosage birth control pills implicating that they wanted to have many birth control fails meaning more pregnancy's
	and that leads to more abortions. maybe You wonder why Planned parenthood has so so many issues and so many negative
	factors, Its because of Planned Parenthood's founder, Margaret Sanger. Sanger targets blacks, Jews, and so much more.
	She once said, "They are an unceasingly spawning class of human being who should have never been born at all."
	She said that referring ti immigrants and catholics.Along with all the other terrible stuff planned parenthood
	has done you can on sex trafficking. pp has sent girls as young as 14 into sex trafficking. Planned parenthood claims
	they offer mammograms but when skeptics went to look around pp, they didnt even own a mammogram machine.
