<h1> Justin Bieber  </h1>
<div class="p"><p> Justin's mom, Pattie Mallette became pregnant at 17 years old. She had multiple people telling her to get 
an abortion and at first, she was going to give in and listen to her friends and family. After some research she 
realized its definitely not something she wants to do. Mallette said in an interview, "I didn't know how I was 
going to do it. But I just knew that I couldn't abort. I had to do my best.
 I had to see what I could do. And I was determined to do whatever it took,"  </div></p></center>
